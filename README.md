# GraphPPL demo

This code base is using the [Julia Language](https://julialang.org/) and
[DrWatson](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/stable/)
to make a reproducible scientific project named
> GraphPPL demo

To (locally) reproduce this project, do the following:

0. Download this code base & download Julia. 
1. Navigate to the project folder in the terminal.
2. Run `julia scripts/run.jl --project=.` in the terminal.

This will install all necessary packages for you to be able to run the scripts and
everything should work out of the box. The plots will be saved in the `plots` folder.
